 * @details
 * Allocates and populates the @c dyad_dtl_ucx internal state struct,

 * buffer, performs a connection warmup, and wires all function pointers
 * in @c ctx->dtl_handle to their UCX implementations:
 *
 * - @c rpc_pack             → @c dyad_dtl_ucx_rpc_pack
 * - @c rpc_unpack           → @c dyad_dtl_ucx_rpc_unpack
 * - @c rpc_respond          → @c dyad_dtl_ucx_rpc_respond
 * - @c rpc_recv_response    → @c dyad_dtl_ucx_rpc_recv_response
 * - @c get_buffer           → @c dyad_dtl_ucx_get_buffer

 * - @c send                 → @c dyad_dtl_ucx_send
 * - @c recv                 → @c dyad_dtl_ucx_recv
 * - @c close_connection     → @c dyad_dtl_ucx_close_connection
 *
 * Initialization proceeds in the following order:
 *
 *  1. Allocates the @c dyad_dtl_ucx struct and initializes all fields
 *     to safe defaults (@c NULL, 0, or @c UCX_MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE).
 *     The Flux handle is borrowed from @c ctx->h as a non-owning pointer.
 *  2. Reads the UCX configuration via @c ucp_config_read().
 *  3. Initializes the UCX context via @c ucp_init() with the following
 *     features enabled:
 *     - @c UCP_FEATURE_RMA — Remote Memory Access for RDMA push.
 *     - @c UCP_FEATURE_AMO32 — 32-bit atomic memory operations.
 *     - @c UCP_FEATURE_TAG — Tag-matching send/receive.
 *     The request size is set to @c sizeof(dyad_ucx_request_t) and
 *     @c dyad_ucx_request_init is registered as the request initializer.
 *     If @p debug is @c true, the UCX configuration is printed to
 *     @c stderr before the config is released.
 *  4. Creates a UCX worker via @c ucp_worker_create() with
 *     @c UCS_THREAD_MODE_SERIALIZED — all UCX calls must be made from
 *     a single thread at a time.
 *  5. Queries the worker's local address via @c ucp_worker_get_address(),
 *     storing it in @c dtl_handle->local_address. This address is sent
 *     to the remote peer during connection establishment so the peer
 *     can create an endpoint back to this worker.
 *  6. Initializes the endpoint cache via @c dyad_ucx_ep_cache_init().
 *     The cache stores @c ucp_ep_h endpoints keyed by remote worker
 *     address to avoid recreating endpoints for repeated transfers to
 *     the same peer.
 *  7. Allocates and registers an RDMA buffer of
 *     @c UCX_MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE + @c sizeof(size_t) bytes via
 *     @c ucx_allocate_buffer(). The extra @c sizeof(size_t) bytes hold
 *     a prepended file size sentinel used by the consumer to detect
 *     when the producer has started the RDMA push. On the consumer side
 *     (@c DYAD_COMM_RECV), also packs the registered memory region into
 *     @c rkey_buf via @c ucp_rkey_pack() so the packed key can be sent
 *     to the producer to authorize the RDMA push. On the producer side
 *     (@c DYAD_COMM_SEND), @c rkey_buf is left as @c NULL since no peer
 *     performs RDMA into the producer's buffer; it will be populated per
 *     transfer in @c dyad_dtl_ucx_rpc_unpack() with the consumer's
 *     packed key decoded from the RPC payload.
 *  8. Wires all DTL function pointers.
 *  9. Performs a loopback connection warmup via @c ucx_warmup() to
 *     prime the UCX connection machinery before the first real transfer.
 *     After warmup, @c dtl_handle->ep is reset to @c NULL.
 *
 * On any error, @c dyad_dtl_ucx_finalize() is called to clean up
 * partially initialized state before returning.

 * @c ucx_recv_no_wait() can use this as a sentinel to detect when the

 * - @c "tag_prod" — Flux rank of the producer broker.
 * - @c "cons_buf" — consumer's RDMA buffer address (@c cons_buf_ptr)
 *                   encoded as a decimal string. The producer uses this

 * - @c "pid_cons" — process ID of the consumer.
 * - @c "addr"     — consumer's UCX worker address, base64-encoded using
 *                   RFC 4648. The producer calls @c ucp_worker_get_address()

 * - @c "rkey"     — consumer's UCX remote key (@c rkey_buf), base64-encoded

 *                   @c ucp_put_nbx().

 * (RFC 4648) before packing and decoded by the producer in
 * @c dyad_dtl_ucx_rpc_unpack(). The encoded buffers are freed after
 * @c json_pack() copies them into the JSON object.
 *
 * @note The UCX backend packs significantly more information than the

/**
 * @brief Finalizes and frees the UCX DTL internal state.
 *
 * @details
 * Releases all UCX resources in the correct teardown order, guarding
 * each step with a @c NULL check to allow safe partial finalization
 * when called after a failed @c dyad_dtl_ucx_init():
 *
 *  1. If @c dtl_handle->ep is non-@c NULL, closes the active connection
 *     via @c dyad_dtl_ucx_close_connection() to destroy the unpacked
 *     remote key and clear per-RPC connection state, then sets
 *     @c ep to @c NULL.
 *  2. If @c dtl_handle->ep_cache is non-@c NULL, finalizes the endpoint
 *     cache via @c dyad_ucx_ep_cache_finalize(), which disconnects and
 *     destroys all cached @c ucp_ep_h endpoints, then sets
 *     @c ep_cache to @c NULL. This is the actual connection teardown —
 *     endpoints are kept alive across RPCs in the cache and are only
 *     destroyed here.
 *  3. If @c dtl_handle->local_address is non-@c NULL, releases the
 *     local worker address via @c ucp_worker_release_address() and
 *     sets it to @c NULL. @c ucp_worker_release_address() must be used
 *     instead of @c free() since the address is UCX-allocated by
 *     @c ucp_worker_get_address().
 *  4. If @c dtl_handle->remote_address is non-@c NULL, frees it with
 *     @c free() and sets it to @c NULL. This handles the case where
 *     @c dyad_dtl_ucx_close_connection() was skipped on an error path
 *     and @c remote_address was not freed there.
 *  5. If @c dtl_handle->rkey is non-@c NULL, destroys the unpacked
 *     remote key handle via @c ucp_rkey_destroy() and sets it to
 *     @c NULL. This is normally @c NULL at finalization since
 *     @c dyad_dtl_ucx_close_connection() destroys it after each
 *     transfer. A non-@c NULL value indicates that
 *     @c close_connection() was skipped on an error path.
 *  6. If @c dtl_handle->rkey_buf is non-@c NULL, releases it and sets
 *     it to @c NULL. The release function differs by @c comm_mode:
 *     @c DYAD_COMM_SEND uses @c free() since @c rkey_buf is a plain
 *     @c malloc() allocation from @c dyad_dtl_ucx_rpc_unpack();
 *     @c DYAD_COMM_RECV uses @c ucp_rkey_buffer_release() since
 *     @c rkey_buf is UCX-allocated by @c ucp_rkey_pack() in
 *     @c ucx_allocate_buffer().
 *  7. If @c dtl_handle->mem_handle is non-@c NULL, unmaps and frees the
 *     pre-allocated RDMA buffer via @c ucx_free_buffer(), which calls
 *     @c ucp_mem_unmap() and sets @c dtl_handle->net_buf to @c NULL.
 *     Then sets @c mem_handle to @c NULL.
 *  8. If @c dtl_handle->ucx_worker is non-@c NULL, destroys the UCX
 *     worker via @c ucp_worker_destroy() and sets it to @c NULL.
 *  9. If @c dtl_handle->ucx_ctx is non-@c NULL, releases the UCX
 *     context via @c ucp_cleanup() and sets it to @c NULL.
 * 10. Sets @c dtl_handle->h to @c NULL. The Flux handle is non-owning
 *     and must not be closed here — it is managed by the DYAD context.
 * 11. Frees the @c dyad_dtl_ucx struct and sets the handle pointer
 *     to @c NULL.
 *
 * If @c ctx->dtl_handle is @c NULL or
 * @c ctx->dtl_handle->private_dtl.ucx_dtl_handle is @c NULL, the
 * function is a no-op and returns @c DYAD_RC_OK.
 *
 * @note The endpoint cache must be finalized before the UCX worker is
 *       destroyed, since endpoint disconnection requires the worker to
 *       be active to flush pending operations.
 *
 * @note @c rkey and @c rkey_buf must be released before the UCX worker
 *       and context are destroyed since they are UCX-managed resources
 *       bound to the UCX context.
 *
 * @note The RDMA buffer must be unmapped before the UCX context is
 *       cleaned up, since @c ucp_mem_unmap() requires a valid UCX
 *       context.
 *
 * @note This function only frees the @c dyad_dtl_ucx struct. The
 *       outer @c dyad_dtl handle is freed by @c dyad_dtl_finalize(),
 *       which calls this function as part of the full teardown sequence.
 *
 * @param[in] ctx DYAD context. On return,
 *                @c ctx->dtl_handle->private_dtl.ucx_dtl_handle
 *                is @c NULL.
 *
 * @return Always returns @c DYAD_RC_OK.
