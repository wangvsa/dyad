 * - @c close_connection     → @c dyad_dtl_margo_close_connection
 *
 * The Mercury/NA protocol is read from the @c DYAD_MARGO_PROTO
 * environment variable (@c DYAD_MARGO_PROTO_ENV). If not set, it
 * defaults to @c "ofi+tcp". The protocol is validated via
 * @c validate_margo_protocol() before @c margo_init() is called.
 *
 * Margo is initialized differently depending on @p comm_mode:
 *
 * - @c DYAD_COMM_SEND (producer / Flux broker side): Margo is
 *   initialized in @c MARGO_CLIENT_MODE with no dedicated progress ES
 *   and no RPC handler ES. The @c data_ready_rpc RPC is registered
 *   without a handler (@c NULL), since the producer only sends RPCs.
 *
 * - @c DYAD_COMM_RECV (consumer / client wrapper side): Margo is
 *   initialized in @c MARGO_SERVER_MODE with a dedicated Execution
 *   Stream (ES) for the Mercury progress loop (@c use_progress_thread=1)
 *   and RPC handlers running in that same ES (@c rpc_thread_count=-1).
 *   The RPC named @c "data_ready_rpc" is registered with @c data_ready_rpc()
 *   as its handler function, and the @c margo_handle is registered a
 *   auxiliary data accessible to the handler via @c margo_registered_data().
 * @note  RPC handlers run in the same Argobots Execution Stream (ES) as the
 *        Mercury progress loop (@c rpc_thread_count=-1), meaning no additional
 *        ES is created for handler execution. This is safe because the consumer
 *        blocks in a busy-wait loop on @c margo_handle->recv_ready until
 *        @c data_ready_rpc() signals completion — there is no concurrent work
 *        that could be starved by sharing the progress loop ES with the handler.
 *
 * Both modes retrieve their own local Margo address via
 * @c margo_addr_self() and initialize @c remote_addr to @c NULL
 * (set during connection establishment).
 *
 * On any error, @c dyad_dtl_margo_finalize() is called to clean up
 * partially initialized state before returning.
 *
 * @param[in] ctx       DYAD context. @c ctx->dtl_handle must already be

 *                      since @c dyad_dtl_init() already stores the mode
 *                      in @c ctx->dtl_handle->mode before dispatch

 * server at @c margo_handle->remote_addr (resolved during
 * @c dyad_dtl_margo_rpc_unpack()) via @c margo_forward(). The RPC
 * payload contains the bulk handle and the buffer size, allowing the

 *
 * @c margo_forward() blocks until the consumer responds, confirming
 * that the RDMA pull is complete. The producer then frees the RPC
 * output and destroys the handle.
 *
 * @note Unlike the Flux RPC backend where the producer needs the original
 *       request message (@c flux_msg_t) as a reply address to route
 *       @c flux_respond_raw() back to the correct consumer, this Margo-based
 *       backend uses an RDMA pull model. During @c dyad_dtl_margo_init(),
 *       the consumer initializes its Margo instance in
 *       @c MARGO_SERVER_MODE so that the producer can connect back to
 *       it. The consumer then embeds its own Margo address as a string
 *       in the Flux RPC request payload via @c dyad_dtl_margo_rpc_pack().
 *       The producer extracts and resolves this address to an
 *       @c hg_addr_t via @c margo_addr_lookup() during
 *       @c dyad_dtl_margo_rpc_unpack(), storing it in
 *       @c margo_handle->remote_addr. This address is used here to

 * completing the RDMA pull from the producer. Once the data is ready,

 * - @c recv_len is reset to 0.
 * - @c recv_ready is reset to 0.
 *
 * @note The data flow for Margo receive is inverted compared to the

 *       data by calling @c flux_respond_raw(), and the consumer reads
 *       it via @c flux_rpc_get_raw(). In this Margo-based backend the producer

 *       @c data_ready_rpc() running on the progress loop ES, not in
 *       this function.
 *
 * @note The busy-wait with @c usleep(100) is a simple polling approach.
