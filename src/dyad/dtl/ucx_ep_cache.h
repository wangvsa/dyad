/**
 * @brief Tests whether a UCX operation status indicates failure.
 *
 * @details
 * UCX operations return @c ucs_status_t values where @c UCS_OK (0)
 * indicates success and any other value indicates an error or in-progress
 * state. This macro simplifies the common pattern of checking for
 * non-@c UCS_OK status after UCX API calls.
 *
 * @note This macro does not distinguish between hard errors and
 *       @c UCS_INPROGRESS — both evaluate to @c true. For operations
 *       that may return @c UCS_INPROGRESS as a normal in-progress
 *       indicator (e.g. @c ucp_request_check_status()), check
 *       @c UCS_INPROGRESS explicitly rather than using this macro.
 *
 * @param status A @c ucs_status_t value returned by a UCX API call.
 * @return Non-zero (true) if @p status is not @c UCS_OK, zero (false)
 *         if @p status is @c UCS_OK.

 * terminate the endpoint without waiting for in-flight operations to
 * complete. If @p ep is @c NULL the function is a no-op.
 *
 * Unlike other UCX non-blocking operations, endpoint close does not
 * use @c dyad_ucx_request_wait() because the close request behaves
 * differently from communication requests — it must be waited on by
 * calling @c ucp_worker_progress() directly rather than through the
 * standard request polling path. The wait loop is therefore inlined:
 *
 *  - If the returned @c stat_ptr is a request handle
 *    (@c UCS_PTR_IS_PTR), spins calling @c ucp_worker_progress() and
 *    @c ucp_request_check_status() until the status is no longer
 *    @c UCS_INPROGRESS, then frees the request via @c ucp_request_free().
 *  - If the returned @c stat_ptr encodes an error
 *    (@c UCS_PTR_IS_ERR), extracts the status code for reporting.
 *  - If @c stat_ptr is @c NULL, the close completed immediately.
 *
 * @note Force-close is used regardless of UCX version. If error handler
 *       mode is enabled in the future, the close mode may need to change
 *       to @c UCP_EP_CLOSE_MODE_FLUSH to allow in-flight operations to
 *       drain before closing (see TODO in source).

 *       normal transfer close — @c dyad_dtl_ucx_close_connection() sets
