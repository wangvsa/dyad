 * @brief Extracts the path component following a managed directory prefix.
 *
 * @details
 * Checks whether @p full begins with @p prefix (separated by @p delim) and,

 *
 * For example, with @p prefix @c "/managed", @p delim @c "/", and @p full
 * @c "/managed/subdir/file.txt", the extracted @p upath would be

 *  - @p full does not begin with @p prefix.
 *  - Any path argument exceeds @c PATH_MAX bytes.
 *  - @p full is equal to @p prefix with no user path component following it.
 *  - The delimiter is not present between @p prefix and the user path in
 *    @p full (e.g. @c "/managed_other/file" does not match prefix
 *    @c "/managed").
 *  - The extracted user path would exceed @p upath_capacity bytes including
 *    the null terminator.
 *
 * If @p prefix itself ends with @p delim, the trailing delimiter is stripped
 * before matching to avoid requiring a double delimiter between the prefix and
 * the user path.

 *  4. Hash and match the canonical form of @p path against the canonical

 *
