 * Chosen to be a few times larger than the typical byte-range request
 * (~50-200KB atom/edge spans in the PECAN workload) so that most requests
 * span only 1-3 blocks, keeping block-edge over-fetch small relative to
 * request size, while still keeping the tracking bitmap small (a 15GB

#define DYAD_RANGE_CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE (64UL * 1024UL)

/**
 * @brief Ensures that @c [offset, offset+length) of @p local_path is
 *        present locally, lazily fetching any missing block-aligned span
 *        from @p origin_path first.
 *
 * @details
 * Tracks which @c DYAD_RANGE_CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE-aligned blocks of
 * @p local_path have already been populated using a bitmap stored in a
 * companion file (@c "<local_path>.dyad_cached"), sized lazily on first
 * touch from @c stat(origin_path). Blocks are filled in write-through: on
 * a miss, the block-aligned span covering @c [offset, offset+length) is
 * read from @p origin_path and written into @p local_path at the same
 * offset, and the corresponding bits are set so later requests (from any
 * process sharing @p local_path, local or remote) hit the cache instead
 * of re-reading the origin.
 *
 * Coordination across concurrent callers uses @c dyad_shared_flock() /
 * @c dyad_excl_flock() on the bitmap file (not on @p local_path itself,
 * so large reads/writes to the data file are never serialized by the
 * bookkeeping lock): a shared lock is used to check for a full hit, and
 * only escalates to an exclusive lock (with a re-check, since another
 * process may have filled the span while this one waited) on a miss.
 *
 * This function does not read data into a caller-supplied buffer itself
 * -- once it returns @c DYAD_RC_OK, the caller is expected to read the
 * requested range from @p local_path exactly as it would if the file had
 * been fully staged upfront (e.g. via @c pread()).
 *
 * @param[in] ctx          DYAD context. Must not be @c NULL.
 * @param[in] local_path   Path to the locally cached copy of the file.
 *                         Created (and sized to match @p origin_path) on
 *                         first touch if it does not already exist.
 * @param[in] origin_path  Path to the authoritative source (e.g. on the
 *                         parallel file system) to fetch missing spans
 *                         from. If @c NULL, this function is a no-op that
 *                         returns @c DYAD_RC_OK immediately, preserving
 *                         the "already fully staged" behavior for callers
 *                         that don't opt in to lazy caching.
 * @param[in] offset       Byte offset of the requested range within the
 *                         file.
 * @param[in] length       Length, in bytes, of the requested range. If 0,
 *                         this function is a no-op that returns
 *                         @c DYAD_RC_OK immediately.
 *
 * @return @c dyad_rc_t    Return code indicating the outcome:
 * @retval DYAD_RC_OK      @p origin_path is @c NULL, @p length is 0, or
 *                         @c [offset, offset+length) is now present in
 *                         @p local_path (either because it already was,
 *                         or because it was just fetched from
 *                         @p origin_path).
 * @retval DYAD_RC_BADFIO  A filesystem operation (open/stat/read/write)
 *                         on @p local_path, its bitmap file, or
 *                         @p origin_path failed.
 * @retval DYAD_RC_SYSFAIL A memory allocation failed.
 * @retval DYAD_RC_BADBUF  @p local_path is too long to build the bitmap
 *                         file's path.
