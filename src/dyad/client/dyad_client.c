/**
 * @brief Generates a hierarchical KVS key from a file path using MurmurHash3.
 *
 * @details
 * Produces a structured KVS key of the form @c "h1.h2...hN.str", where each
 * @c hN is a hexadecimal hash bucket value and @c str is the original file path.
 * The number of hash levels is controlled by @p depth and the number of buckets
 * per level by @p width.
 *
 * Each level is computed by applying MurmurHash3_x64_128 to @p str with a
 * different seed (drawn from a fixed table of primes, cycling every 10 levels),
 * then reducing the four 32-bit hash words via XOR and taking the result modulo
 * @p width to select a bucket. The buckets from all levels are concatenated with
 * @c '.' separators, followed by the original @p str appended as the final
 * component.
 *
 * If @p str is shorter than 128 bytes, it is padded with @c '@' characters to
 * 128 bytes before hashing to improve hash distribution for short paths.
 *
 * The hierarchical structure distributes keys across a tree of KVS directories,
 * avoiding hot spots that would occur if all keys were stored at the same level.
 * @p depth and @p width together control the fanout and depth of this tree.
 *
 * @param[in]  str       File path to encode as a KVS key. Must not be @c NULL
 *                       or empty.
 * @param[out] path_key  Buffer to receive the generated key. Must not be @c NULL.
 *                       On success, contains a null-terminated string of the form
 *                       @c "h1.h2...hN.str".
 * @param[in]  len       Size of the @p path_key buffer in bytes. Must be greater
 *                       than zero and large enough to hold the full key including
 *                       the null terminator.
 * @param[in]  depth     Number of hash levels (directory levels) in the key.
 *                       Must be no greater than 10 to stay within the seed table;
 *                       larger values cycle through the seed table.
 * @param[in]  width     Number of buckets per hash level. Controls the fanout at
 *                       each directory level of the KVS key tree.
 *
 * @return int
 * @retval  0  The key was successfully generated and written to @p path_key.
 * @retval -1  @p str, @p path_key, or @p len is invalid, @p str is empty, or
 *             the generated key exceeded @p len.

/**
 * @brief Retrieves file metadata from the Flux KVS for an internal consumer operation.
 *
 * @details
 * Looks up metadata for the file identified by @p upath in the Flux KVS,
 * blocking until the producer publishes it. This is the internal counterpart
 * to @c dyad_get_metadata(), used exclusively by @c dyad_consume().
 *
 * After retrieving metadata, the function determines whether a remote data
 * transfer is actually needed by checking if the producer and consumer reside
 * on the same node. This is done by comparing @c mdata->owner_rank / @c ctx->service_mux
 * against @c ctx->node_idx. If they match, the producer is on the same node and
 * the file is already locally accessible, so the metadata object is freed and
 * set to @c NULL to signal to @c dyad_consume() that the data transfer step
 * should be skipped.
 *
 * Note that this locality check is only relevant for node-local storage. When
 * shared storage is enabled, @c dyad_consume() never uses the metadata for data
 * transfer regardless, so the check is not needed in that path.
 *
 * The @c mdata == @c NULL convention on return is therefore not an error condition
 * but a deliberate signal that the data transfer step should be skipped.
 *
 * This function is not intended to be called directly by users.
 *
 * @param[in]  ctx    Pointer to the DYAD context. Must not be @c NULL.
 * @param[in]  fname  Absolute path to the file being consumed.
 * @param[in]  upath  Path to the file relative to the consumer-managed directory.
 *                    Used to generate the Flux KVS lookup key.
 * @param[out] mdata  Address of a @c dyad_metadata_t pointer. Always set to
 *                    @c NULL on entry. On success, either points to the retrieved
 *                    metadata if a remote transfer is needed, or remains @c NULL
 *                    if the producer is on the same node and the file is already
 *                    locally accessible.
 *
 * @return @c dyad_rc_t return code indicating the outcome:
 * @retval DYAD_RC_OK   Metadata was successfully retrieved, or the producer is
 *                      on the same node and no transfer is needed (@p mdata will
 *                      be @c NULL).
 * @retval DYAD_RC_*    Any error code propagated from @c dyad_kvs_read().
 *
 * @note Unlike @c dyad_get_metadata(), this function always blocks until the
 *       producer publishes the file's metadata to the KVS.
 * @note The @c service_mux field in @p ctx controls how many Flux broker ranks
 *       map to a single node, and is used to determine node-level locality.

/**
 * @brief Retrieves file data from a remote producer's Flux broker via RPC.
 *
 * @details
 * Dispatches a streaming Flux RPC to the DYAD module running on the producer's
 * broker (identified by @p mdata->owner_rank) and retrieves the file data via
 * the configured Data Transport Layer (DTL). The retrieved data is returned in
 * @p file_data and its length in @p file_len.
 *
 * The sequence of operations is:
 *  1. Pack an RPC payload containing the file path and producer rank.
 *  2. Send a streaming Flux RPC to the producer's DYAD module.
 *  3. Receive and parse the RPC response.
 *  4. Establish a DTL connection to the producer.
 *  5. Receive the file data over the DTL connection.
 *  6. Close the DTL connection.
 *  7. Wait for the end-of-stream RPC message from the producer module.
 *
 * The streaming RPC protocol expects exactly one data message followed by an
 * end-of-stream signal (indicated by @c ENODATA). If additional messages arrive
 * or the module reports an error, @c DYAD_RC_BADRPC is returned. Two return
 * codes from the DTL have special meaning and bypass the end-of-stream wait:
 * @c DYAD_RC_RPC_FINISHED (end of stream already received) and
 * @c DYAD_RC_BADRPC (a prior RPC operation failed irrecoverably).
 *
 * When built with UCX DTL support (@c DYAD_ENABLE_UCX_DTL), the producer
 * prepends the file size to the data buffer. This prefix is extracted and
 * stripped before returning, so @p file_data always points to the raw file
 * contents.
 *
 * This function is an internal helper called by @c dyad_consume() and
 * @c dyad_consume_w_metadata(). It is not intended to be called directly
 * by users.
 *
 * @param[in]  ctx        Pointer to the DYAD context. Must not be @c NULL.
 *                        Provides the Flux handle, DTL handle, and other
 *                        connection parameters.
 * @param[in]  mdata      Metadata for the file to retrieve. Must not be @c NULL.
 *                        @c mdata->fpath and @c mdata->owner_rank identify the
 *                        file and the producer broker to contact.
 * @param[out] file_data  Address of a pointer to be set to the buffer containing
 *                        the retrieved file data. The buffer is allocated by the
 *                        DTL layer. The caller is responsible for releasing it
 *                        via @c ctx->dtl_handle->return_buffer().
 * @param[out] file_len   Address of a @c size_t to be set to the number of bytes
 *                        in @p file_data.
 *
 * @return @c dyad_rc_t return code indicating the outcome:
 * @retval DYAD_RC_OK           File data was successfully retrieved.
 * @retval DYAD_RC_BADRPC       An RPC operation failed, the producer module sent
 *                              an unexpected number of responses, or the module
 *                              reported an error.
 * @retval DYAD_RC_BADFIO       UCX DTL only: the producer-prepended file size
 *                              was negative, indicating a read failure on the
 *                              producer side.

/**
 * @brief Writes file data retrieved from a producer to the consumer-managed directory.
 *
 * @details
 * Stores @p data_len bytes of @p file_data to the appropriate path under the
 * consumer-managed directory, as determined by combining @c ctx->cons_managed_path
 * with the relative file path in @p mdata->fpath. Any intermediate directories
 * that do not yet exist are created as needed.
 *
 * For large files (at or above @c DYAD_POSIX_TRANSFER_GRANULARITY bytes), the
 * data is written in chunks of @c DYAD_POSIX_TRANSFER_GRANULARITY rather than
 * in a single @c write() call.
 *
 * This function is an internal helper called by @c dyad_consume() and
 * @c dyad_consume_w_metadata() after data has been retrieved from the producer
 * via @c dyad_get_data(). It is not intended to be called directly by users.
 *
 * @param[in] ctx        Pointer to the DYAD context. Must not be @c NULL. Used to
 *                       resolve the consumer-managed path and check the @c check flag.
 * @param[in] mdata      Metadata for the file being stored. Must not be @c NULL.
 *                       @c mdata->fpath is appended to @c ctx->cons_managed_path to
 *                       form the full destination path.
 * @param[in] fd         Open, writable file descriptor for the destination file.
 * @param[in] data_len   Number of bytes to write from @p file_data.
 * @param[in] file_data  Buffer containing the file data to write. Must be at least
 *                       @p data_len bytes in size.
 *
 * @return @c dyad_rc_t return code indicating the outcome:
 * @retval DYAD_RC_OK      All @p data_len bytes were successfully written.
 * @retval DYAD_RC_BADFIO  Directory creation failed, a @c write() call failed,
 *                         or the total bytes written does not match @p data_len.
 *
 * @note If the operation succeeds and @c ctx->check is set, the environment
 *       variable @c DYAD_CHECK_ENV is set to @c "ok".

/**
 * @brief Synchronizes the parent directory of a file to ensure its entry is
 *        durably written to storage.
 *
 * @details
 * Opens the parent directory of @p path and calls @c fsync() on it to flush
 * any pending directory entry updates to stable storage. This is necessary
 * after creating a new file to guarantee that the directory entry is durable
 * and visible to other processes, even in the event of a system crash. See
 * https://lwn.net/Articles/457671/ for background.
 *
 * This is particularly important in the DYAD producer path — calling
 * @c dyad_commit() to publish a file to the KVS before the directory entry
 * is synced could allow a consumer to attempt to open the file before it is
 * visible in the directory.
 *
 * @c ctx->reenter is saved and restored around the directory open and sync
 * operations to prevent re-entrant interception of the @c open() call.
 *
 * @param[in]     ctx   Pointer to the DYAD context. May be @c NULL, in which
 *                      case the @c reenter guard is skipped. If non-@c NULL,
 *                      @c ctx->reenter is temporarily set to @c false during
 *                      the operation.
 * @param[in]     path  Path to the file whose parent directory is to be synced.
 *                      Must not be @c NULL. The parent directory is derived via
 *                      @c dirname().
 *
 * @return int
 * @retval  0  The parent directory was successfully opened, synced, and closed.
 * @retval -1  The parent directory could not be opened, @c fsync() failed, or
 *             @c close() failed.
 *
 * @note All three operations (open, fsync, close) are attempted even if one
 *       fails — the return code reflects whether any of them failed, but does
 *       not distinguish which one.
