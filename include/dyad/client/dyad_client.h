/**
 * @brief Ensures a file under a DYAD-managed directory is ready to be read.
 *
 * @details
 * If @p fname falls under the consumer-managed path, this function ensures the
 * file is fully available before the caller proceeds to read it.
 *
 * If @p fname is not under the consumer-managed path, the function returns
 * @c DYAD_RC_OK immediately without taking any action.
 *
 * The behavior depends on the underlying storage configuration:
 *
 * - **Shared storage** (e.g., a parallel or network filesystem visible across
 *   multiple nodes): The file is visible to all consumers if it exists. An
 *   exclusive lock is acquired to synchronize access. A file size of zero
 *   indicates the producer has not yet written the file, so the lock is
 *   released and the function waits for the file to be published via the
 *   Flux KVS before returning. No data transfer is performed since the file
 *   is directly accessible once available.
 *
 * - **Node-local storage**: The file being empty means it is either not yet
 *   produced or not yet visible locally. While holding the exclusive lock, the
 *   function waits for the file to be published via the Flux KVS. Since the
 *   producer does not participate in locking, it may write the file during
 *   this wait. When metadata is returned by @c dyad_fetch_metadata(), if the
 *   file has local visibility (e.g., the producer is on the same node and has
 *   already written the file), @c dyad_fetch_metadata() frees and nulls the
 *   metadata object to signal that no remote transfer is needed. Otherwise,
 *   the file data is retrieved from the remote producer's Flux broker via
 *   @c dyad_get_data(), written to local disk, and the lock is released.
 *
 *  * An exclusive lock is acquired to serve two purposes. First, the producer
 * acquires the lock in @c dyad_open_wrapper() to prevent consumers with
 * direct file visibility (e.g. via shared storage or co-location on the
 * same node) from reading a partially written file, and releases it in
 * @c dyad_close_wrapper() once the file is fully written. Second, the
 * consumer acquires the lock here to ensure that only one consumer performs
 * the data fetch at a time, with other consumers blocking until the lock is
 * released. Because POSIX @c fcntl locks are cooperative, these guarantees
 * only hold between processes that also participate in locking.
